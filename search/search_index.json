They are listed below.</p> <ul> <li> <p>KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Make sure your changes do not affect the simplicity and readability of the documentation in a negative way.</p> </li> <li> <p>If it ain\u2019t broken, don\u2019t redesign it. Do not propose changes to how the UI should look.</p> </li> <li> <p>Editing the HTML export is like painting a screenshot \u2014 impressive, but pointless. Make Pull Requests for the <code>main</code> branch of the docs, NEVER to the other branches.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixing typos is noble; flooding PRs with them is chaos. Typo squatting is perfectly fine and helpful, but don't make too many Pull Requests to fix typos in a row, as it causes unnecessary spam. The best alternative is to \"bundle\" several typo fixes in one PR.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are no stupid questions \u2014 only unanswered ones (and I try to avoid those). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, as we try to reply to all. Sadly, OceanApocalypseStudios doesn't have a straight-forward way of contacting (yet), therefore I'll allow users with questions to use my public e-mail instead: <code>real_mf366@yahoo.com</code>.</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
