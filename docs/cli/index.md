# RSML directly in your Terminal
Red Sea's CLI (`RSML.CLI`) was made with the intention of serving as a quick, easy-to-use and simple way to evaluate RSML files using the [`official-25`](../language/standards/official-25.md) and [`roadlike`](../language/standards/roadlike.md) [language standards](../language/standards/index.md).

It is used by [RSML for Python](../api/python/index.md) to simulate using the actual RSML DLL, even though that's not what actually happens. At least, not directly via Python.

While simple, it still allows for a great number of things and if you need an evaluation and you need it fast, there's no need to create a new project, install the dependencies, setup the standards, etc. All you need to do is run a command directly in your terminal.

## Installation
RSML's CLI is portable and cross-platform, meaning it does not require any installation.

All you need to do is get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/OceanApocalypseStudios/RedSeaMarkupLanguage/releases/v1.0.5/).

## Usage
For its usage, we recommend checking out [the Commands page](commands.md).
