# Contributing
**We really appreciate contributions** - they help us focus on releasing faster and better.

That being said, there are some rules and guidelines you must follow.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-lightbulb:{ .lg .middle } **KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.**

    ---

    Make sure your changes are understandable and do not affect the simplicity of the documentation negatively.

-   :material-source-branch:{ .lg .middle } **Know your branches.**

    ---

    Make changes to `main`, ==**NEVER**== to `gh-pages`.
    
-   :fontawesome-solid-paint-roller:{ .lg .middle } **If it ain't broken, don't redesign it.**

    ---

    Unless the current theme/CSS feels wrong or is broken, don't change it. Seriously. Don't.

-   :material-format-font:{ .lg .middle } **Fixing typos is noble; flooding PRs with them is chaos.**

    ---

    Typo squatting is perfectly fine and helpful, but don't make too many _Pull Requests_ to fix typos in a row, as it causes unnecessary spam. The best alternative is to _"bundle"_ several typo fixes in one PR.

## Questions
Sadly, **OceanApocalypseStudios** does not have a formal way of contact _(yet)_. Therefore, I'll allow users with questions to use my public e-mail instead, but please only make use of it if the questions are really, _really_ important. Thank you.
