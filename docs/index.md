# Welcome to Red Sea Markup Language Docs
**Red Sea Markup Language** is **the** powerful and robust fork of [MF's CrossRoad Solution](https://mf366-coding.github.io/documentation/mfroad/mfroad_1.0.html), a language designed to dynamically interpret different logic paths based on the local host OS and CPU architecture.

RSML (short for Red Sea Markup Language) can currently be used in C# and Python, as well as in its own CLI.
