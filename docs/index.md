# Welcome to Red Sea Markup Language Docs
!!! warning
    The documentation for RSML is a work in progress.

**Red Sea Markup Language** is **the** powerful and robust fork of [MF's CrossRoad Solution](https://mf366-coding.github.io/documentation/mfroad/mfroad_1.0.html "MFRoad"), a ==language designed to dynamically interpret different logic paths based on the local host OS and CPU architecture.==

RSML (short for Red Sea Markup Language) can currently be used in C# and Python, as well as in its own CLI.

## Why use Red Sea Markup Language?
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :fontawesome-solid-code-branch:{ .lg .middle } **Made for logic, logically.**

    ---

    RSML is logic-heavy and therefore, everything about it is logical and easy to understand and use. One could say everything about it makes sense.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: The Language](language/index.md)

-   :material-package-variant:{ .lg .middle } **Easily embeddable.**

    ---

    RSML is, obviously, intended to be used programmatically. RSML's fresh and easy API allow for an excellent experience embedding RSML into your program.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: The API](api/index.md)

-   :fontawesome-solid-terminal:{ .lg .middle } **Directly in your Terminal.**

    ---

    Heavy-logic shouldn't mean "open your editor and start writing `if` clauses". That's where RSML's handy CLI comes in. It's a great way to quickly evaluate RSML files, at a relatively less complex level, without having to jump into your editor and write code.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: The CLI](cli/index.md)

-   :simple-opensourceinitiative:{ .lg .middle } **Our love for Open Source.**

    ---

    RSML is the creation of a software and indie-game studios _(OceanApocalypseStudios)_ that loves open-source. We can assure it will be free and open-source forever. It's also licensed under the [very permissive MIT License](https://mit-license.org), which is more than great!

-   :simple-github:{ .lg .middle } **GitHub Repository**

    ---

    The official repository for Red Sea Markup Language.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Visit](https://github.com/OceanApocalypseStudios/RedSeaMarkupLanguage)

-   :simple-nuget:{ .lg .middle } **NuGet Package**

    ---

    RSML for C# is the main way to use RSML, so the NuGet link is going to be one of your best bets for getting help, among other things, even if you're using RSML with a language other than C#.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Visit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RSML/)

-   :simple-python:{ .lg .middle } **RSML for Python**

    ---

    RSML for Python was the first port of RSML to another programming language to exist.

-   :material-file-document:{ .lg .middle } **RSML's Documentation Repository.**

    ---

    While it might seem a bit redundant _(after all, you're already here)_, it's useful if you wish to build the documentation locally, that is, if you want a offline copy of it.
