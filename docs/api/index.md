# RSML as an API
!!! tip
    It's recommended to know the actual [language](../language/index.md) itself before learning how to use RSML programmatically.

RSML truly becomes powerful when used programmatically. As of right now, RSML can _officially_ be used in two programming languages: [**C#**](csharp/index.md) and [**Python**](python/index.md).

RSML is written in C#, so if you want maximum support, it's recommended you go with the same language.

## Getting Started
To get started using RSML programmatically, first pick one of those languages. Then, follow their own guides, as setup is different for both.

After following the installation and setup guide, you can view our [usage examples](demos.md) or actual [how-to guides](guides/index.md).

## Why use RSML's API?
If used simply as a language, RSML does not do much. It's the evaluation process that gives it power, and it can only be evaluated via an interface. That's where programming languages come into play.
