# Contributing
**We really appreciate contributions** - they help us focus on releasing faster and better.

That being said, there are some rules and guidelines you must follow. They are listed below.

* **KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid.** Make sure your changes do not affect the simplicity and readability of the documentation in a negative way.

* **If it ain’t broken, don’t redesign it.** Do not propose changes to how the UI should look.

* **Editing the HTML export is like painting a screenshot — impressive, but pointless.** Make _Pull Requests_ for the `main` branch of the docs, **NEVER** to the other branches.

* **Fixing typos is noble; flooding PRs with them is chaos.** Typo squatting is perfectly fine and helpful, but don't make too many _Pull Requests_ to fix typos in a row, as it causes unnecessary spam. The best alternative is to _"bundle"_ several typo fixes in one PR.

* **There are no stupid questions — only unanswered ones (and I try to avoid those).** If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, as we try to reply to all. Sadly, OceanApocalypseStudios doesn't have a straight-forward way of contacting _(yet)_, therefore I'll allow users with questions to use my public e-mail instead: [`real_mf366@yahoo.com`](mailto:real_mf366@yahoo.com).
